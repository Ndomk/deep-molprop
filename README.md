# Protein Metal Partial Charge Prediction

This project explores machine learning methods for predicting **partial charges** of metal ions bound in protein environments.

Metal centers in proteins (e.g., zinc, iron, magnesium) experience highly heterogeneous local environments. Accurately modeling their partial charges is important for:
- molecular dynamics force fields
- quantum chemistry approximations
- mechanistic interpretation of active sites

This capstone project implements an ML-based regression pipeline to learn partial charges from structural and chemical features of the metal environment.
